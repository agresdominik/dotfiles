Some custom config and dotfiles I use on my devices

The entire `nvim` folder can be copied in ~/.config/nvim 

## Zsh

`.zshrc` in home dir using [Oh my Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh)

## i3 Tiling window Manager (Linux)

Config file, wallpapers and scripts are in `i3/` and i3blocks can be found in `etc/`
